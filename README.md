```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Once installed, you can start using Seeker-o1 with the provided examples:

```python
from seeker_o1.core.agent.tool_agent import ToolAgent

# Create an agent with calculator capabilities
agent = ToolAgent(tools=["calculator"])

# Execute a calculation
response = agent.execute("Calculate 2 + 2 * 3")
print(response)
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### Basic Examples

#### Text Processing

```python
from seeker_o1.core.agent.tool_agent import ToolAgent
